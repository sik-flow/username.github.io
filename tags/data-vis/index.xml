      <description>I recently came across this dataset from the FEC that had presidental candidate funding. I downloaded funding from Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, and Elizabeth Warren. After downloading the dataset I first wanted to see how much each of the candidates had raised in 2019.
Year to date - Bernie has raised slightly more money than Warren, with Biden in third place overall. Bernie has made it a point in the past to make it be known that his supporters donate less on average than other candidates.</description>
