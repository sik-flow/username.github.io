      <description>The NFL has a famous chart for quantitatively assigning a value to a draft pick (NFL Draft Pick Chart). Could something similar be made for hockey to assign values to NHL draft picks?
The Data I scraped data NHL draft data from the 2000 draft to the 2010 draft from Elite Prospects. I collected player statistics from 2,741 players that were drafted during this time. To normalize the data, I only grabbed players that were drafted in the first 210 picks, as the 2010 draft only had 7 rounds and previous drafts had more rounds.</description>

Jack Hughes came into the NHL with a lot of hype after average 2 points per game in the USHL and scoring 20 points in 7 games in the U18 World Championships. Jack Hughes got drafted by the New Jersey Devils and did not score at the rate his hype was predicting). In this post I am going to analyze if we should be concerned about Jack Hughes?</description>
